= PROJECT: Car park Finder
---
== Overview

Car park finder is a desktop address book application to find HDB (Housing Development Board) car parks in Singapore.
It allows you to work with a *Command Line Interface (CLI)* to display a list of car parks with the convenience of simply typing.
If you *use the computer frequently* and *commute by driving*, you would find our application useful in helping you obtain various information about car parks.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Modified the *find feature to search for partial words* and *ignore certain words*.
** What it does: Allows the user to search for partial instances of words without needed to type everything.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can type lesser and the app should provide the same data still.
** Highlights:  This enhancement affects the existing commands and commands to be added in the future. I also wrote extra code which allowed us to re-use in the future.

* *Minor enhancements*:
** Pulled postal code information using coordinates data by querying an API to convert it to store in a file for quick loading.
** Updated HTML,CSS and Javascript for google maps display with real time updates from each individual commands.
** Credits: [https://github.com/cgcai/SVY21[SVY21 to WGS84]].
