== PROJECT: Car park Finder

== Overview

Car park finder is a desktop address book application to find HDB (Housing Development Board) car parks in Singapore.
It allows you to work with a *Command Line Interface (CLI)* to display a list of car parks with the convenience of simply typing.
If you *use the computer frequently* and *commute by driving*, you would find our application useful in helping you obtain various information about car parks.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Add auto-complete feature to commands that require parameters.
** What it does: It prompts the user the full format of a command.
** Justification: It improves the product significantly because some of our commands can have up to three parameters. Memorising the full format is time-consuming.
** Highlights: This enhancement allows the user to highlight the next parameter placeholder after one placeholder is filled up.

* *Minor enhancement*: Add command abbreviation feature to most frequently used commands.
** What it does: It allows the user to type less for the same functionality.
** Justification: It improves the product significantly because command words can be long and typed wrongly easily.
** Highlights: This enhancement is very intuitive and thus easy to use.

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the Developer Guide. They showcase my ability to write technical documentation and the technical depth of my contributions to the project._
|===

=== Architecture overview

This section explains the design architecture used by the entire system.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.


.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_architecture diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App,
 which contains 6 <<Architecture-Components,*`architecture components`*>> and
 adopts an <<Architecture-design,*`events-driven nature`*>>.

[[Architecture-Components]]
=== Architecture components

This section will briefly introduce the function of each architecture components
as well as common behaviours.

.Architecture Components
|===
|Component |Main Function

|<<Design-Main,*`Main`*>>
|the starting point of the system, which encapsulates the other components.

|<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>>
|represents a collection of classes used by multiple components.

|<<Design-Ui,*`User Interface`*>>
|contains the user interface classes used by the application.

|<<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>
|execute user commands, also known as the command executor.

|<<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>
|holds the data of the application in-memory.

|<<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>
|which allows reading and writing of data to the hard disk.
|===

[NOTE]
Each of the User Interface, Logic, Model, Storage Components also:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the *_class diagram_* given below) defines it's API in the `Logic` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Architecture-design]]
=== Events-driven nature of the design

This section explains the main nature of design adopted by the system.

The *_sequence diagram_* below shows how the components interact when the user issues the command `find sengkang`.

.Component interactions for `find sengkang` command (part 1)
image::Sequence diagram - Find Carpark.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `CarparkFinderChangedEvent` when the Car Park Finder data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The *_sequence diagram_* below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `find sengkang` command (part 2)
image::Sequence diagram - Find Carpark Event Handling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how the Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Main]]
=== Main component

The `Main` component consists of only one class, link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* At app launch: initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them with one another.
* At shut down: shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Commons component

The `Commons` component consists of classes used by multiple other components. Two of these classes play important roles at the architectural level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

[NOTE]
Classes used by multiple components are put in the seedu.carparkfinder.commons package.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== User interface component

The `User Interface` (`UI`) component consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of different parts.
The base class
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`] uses _JavaFx UI_ framework.

Please refer to the *_class diagram_* below for more details on how they are connected.

.Structure of the User Interface component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

In general, this is the workflow of the `UI` component:

. Execute user commands using the `Logic` component.
. Bind itself to some data in the `Model` so that the `UI` components can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
. Respond to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the `UI` components accordingly.

All `UI` parts, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class. The layout for each
component is defined in matching `.fxml` files and can be found in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.

For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`]
is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

The `Logic` component consist of a `LogicManager` that takes care of the parse and exexcution of commands.
It inherits the base class link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`].

Please refer to the *_class diagram_* below for more details on how they are connected.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

In general, this is the workflow of the `Logic` component:

.  Get the `CarparkFinderParser` class to parse the user command.
.  Create a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  Pass the result of the command execution over to `Model`, which can affect it (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  Return the command execution by encapsulating the command as a `CommandResult` object which then is passed back to the `UI`.

The *_sequence diagram_* below shows the interactions within the `Logic` component
when `execute("delete 1")` is called.

.Sequence Diagram of of `execute("delete 1")
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

The `Model` component is managed by the `ModelManager` that stores the data of Car Park Finder.
It does not depend on any of the three other components.
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`] is the base class.


Please refer to the *_class diagram_* below for more details.

.Structure of the Model Component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]


In general, this is the structure of the `Model` Component:

* The `ModelManager` extends the `Model` Interface.

* It stores a `VersionedCarparkFinder` and a `UserPref` object.
** The `UserPref` object represents the user's preferences.
** The `VersionedCarparkFinder` contains a `carparkFinderStateList` which is used to store multiple `Carpark` objects.


* The `ModelManager` also manages a filtered list of `Carpark` objects filtered from the `carparkFinderStateList`.

* The `Model component` exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Carpark>` that can be 'observed'
e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that it automatically updates when data in the list changes.


[NOTE]
As a OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in Car Park Finder, which `Carpark` can reference.
This would allow Car Park Finder to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of
each `Carpark` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below.
 +

.Use of Tag object
image::ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]



[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

The `Storage` component, managed by the `StorageManager`, serves as a backend storage for data of Car Park Finder.
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`] is the base class.

Please refer to the *_class diagram_* below for more details on how they are connected.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[localcopy]]
The `Storage` component can perform the following functions:

* save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* save the Car Park Finder data in xml format and read it back.

=== Abbreviation Feature

The abbreviation feature reduces the amount of characters needed to type.

==== Overview

The abbreviation mechanism is facilitated by `CarparkFinderParser`. It extends the cases
to allow command abbreviations to be parsed through `parseCommand` as well.

==== Example

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the abbreviation mechanism behaves at
each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `LogicManager`
is initialized with an `CarparkFinderParser`.

Step 2. The user executes `f` command instead of `find`. The `Matcher` object in
`CarparkFinderParser` splits the command text into _command word_ and
_arguments_, in which the _command word_ is parsed using a _switch_
statement.

Step 3. This _command word_ will be matched to a `COMMAND_ABBREVIATION` from
`ListCommand`, which holds the value of 'f'. As the program finds a match, it
proceeds as if a `find` command is given.

.Flow chart of command abbreviation usage.
image::ActivityDiagram-abbreviation.png[width="700", align="left"]

The _Activity Diagram_ above explains what happens when a user executes a `f`
command.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How abbreviation executes

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* declare `COMMAND_ABBREVIATION` with a string value
in each Command file.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Easy to implement
|Cons| Have to decide on each abbreviation subjectively which brings down performance
       if there are a lot of commands
|===
+

* *Alternative 2:* declare `COMMAND_ABBREVIATION` using the first two characters of `COMMAND_WORD`
in each Command file.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Better performance as abbreviations will be assigned systematically.
|Cons| When there are 2 command words starting with same two characters e.g. `find` & `filter`, this does not work.
|===

=== Auto-complete Feature

The auto-complete feature simplifies overcomplicated commands by prompting correct format.

==== Overview

The auto-complete mechanism is facilitated by `CommandBox`. It calls `autocomplete()`
to `displayFormat()` if applicable command word is entered or to highlight the next
parameter if full format is already provided in the command box.

==== Example

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the auto-complete mechanism behaves at
each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user enters `fi` in command box and then presses kbd:[Tab] . `autoComplete()`
compares `input` through the list of applicable command words and abbreviations, and
proceeds to `displayFormat()` because `fi` is an applicable `COMMAND_ABBREVIATION`. It
moves on to highlight its first placeholder, `DAY`, in the command line. As seen
from the following diagrams.

.After `fi` is entered.
image::screenshot-fi.png[width="700", align="left"]

.After kbd:[Tab] is pressed for the first time.
image::screenshot-fiFirstArgSelected.png[width="700", align="left"]

Step 3. The user replaces `DAY` with an actual value, `SUN`, and presses 'Tab'
key again. `autoComplete()` is called again, but because this time it checks that `input`
`isFilterCommandFormat`, the next placeholder, `START_TIME`, is highlighted. Result
is shown in the following diagram.

.After kbd:[Tab] is pressed for the second time.
image::screenshot-fiSecondArgSelected.png[width="700", align="left"]

Step 4. The user continues step 3 until all placeholders are filled up with actual
values and then presses kbd:[Enter]  to execute this command.

.Activity Diagram for Auto Completion Mechanism.
image::ActivityDiagram-autocompletion.png[width="700", align="left"]

The _Activity Diagram_ above explains what happens when user presses kbd:[Tab].

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: TextInput

* *Alternative 1:* (current choice): Continue to use the original TextField
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| External library enables bindAutocompletion for TextField (the drop down
list of suggested commands that appears and updates itself as user types).
External library enables bindAutocompletion for TextField (the drop down list of
 suggested commands that appears and updates itself as user types).
|Cons| Text formatting is limited. All text in the TextField must have the same format.
|===

* *Alternative 2:* Create additional TextField as user request for additional fields
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Allows for different formatting for different fields (Commands can have a
 different colour from the fields)
|Cons|Original structure will be disrupted. Command box will no longer be single
line text input, which have consequences such as the user cannot backspace or
select through the entire line.
