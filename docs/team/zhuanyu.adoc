Hello! My name is Zhuan Yu and I am a second year Computer Science undergraduate. As an aspiring programmer, I want to
show people about the joy of coding through samples of my work.

I am currently a developer for _Car Park Finder_, a team project to be completed as part of the module CS2103T Software Engineering in NUS.

== PROJECT: Car Park Finder
:sectnums:

== Overview

_Car Park Finder_ is a desktop command-line application for all car owners seeking a hassle-free way to find
HDB (Housing Development Board) car parks in Singapore. +

Our application allows you to view vital information such as lots availability for each car park, so that you can
plan ahead of your trip.

If you use the computer frequently and commute by driving, why not try out
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T09-4/main/releases[_Car Park Finder_]. No installation is required and getting
started is as simple as typing out a text message.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: https://github.com/google/gson[Gson] library for converting JSON data from data.gov.sg database to Java Objects for use in the project. +

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
